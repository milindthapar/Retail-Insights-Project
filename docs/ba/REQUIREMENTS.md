# Requirements – Retail Revenue Insights Platform

This document outlines the **Functional**, **Non-Functional**, **Data**, **Reporting**, and **Security** requirements for the Retail Revenue Insights system.

---

# 1. Functional Requirements (FR)

## FR1 – Data Ingestion
The system must ingest retail sales data from a CSV source and load it into Azure SQL through a Python ETL pipeline.

## FR2 – Data Cleaning & Validation
The system must clean the raw dataset by:
- Handling encoding issues  
- Removing duplicates  
- Parsing dates correctly  
- Validating numeric columns  
- Aligning schema to SQL table structure  

## FR3 – Cloud Data Storage
The system must store cleaned sales data in a central Azure SQL database as the **source of truth**.

## FR4 – Automated ETL Refresh
A scheduled automation must run daily to:
- Load fresh data  
- Truncate the SQL table  
- Insert updated records  
- Log execution results  

## FR5 – Reporting Dashboard
Power BI must provide a multi-page dashboard with:
- Executive KPIs  
- Time-series analysis  
- Customer segmentation  
- Product profitability  
- Discount impact  
- Forecasting  

## FR6 – Filtering & Drill-Down
The dashboard must allow filtering by:
- Date  
- Region  
- Segment  
- Category  
- Customer  
- Product  

And support drill-down to city or product level.

## FR7 – Forecasting Capability
Both Power BI forecasting and Python ARIMA forecasting must be used to project future revenue trends.

## FR8 – User Access & Sharing
Business users must access the report via Power BI Service with appropriate permissions.

---

# 2. Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)

## NFR1 – Performance
Dashboards must load within **5–8 seconds** when refreshed.

## NFR2 – Scalability
The system should support growth from **10K rows to 500K+ rows** without redesign.

## NFR3 – Reliability
Automated ETL must maintain a **success rate of 95%+**, with logs for failure tracking.

## NFR4 – Security
- Azure SQL must use encrypted connections (ODBC Driver 18)  
- No sensitive credentials may be stored in plain text  
- Power BI access must follow workspace permissions  

## NFR5 – Usability
Dashboard navigation must be intuitive, with clear labels and minimal clutter.

## NFR6 – Maintainability
Code, SQL, and documentation must be structured for easy updates.

# 3. Data Requirements

- Dataset must contain: Order, Customer, Shipping, Product, Sales, Discount, Profit  
- Date fields must be stored in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)  
- No missing or invalid Order Date records  
- Profit = Sales − Cost (already supplied in dataset)

---

# 4. Reporting Requirements

The following insights must be visible:

- Total Revenue / Total Profit / Margin  
- Revenue & profit trends over time  
- Category & sub-category breakdown  
- Regional & state performance  
- Customer segmentation (value/risk)  
- Discount impact analysis  
- Product profitability ranking  
- Forecast for upcoming months  
- Automated daily refresh in Power BI Service  

---

# 5. Security & Access Requirements

- Azure SQL credentials stored securely (environment variables preferred)  
- Power BI workspace must restrict edit access  
- Only authorised roles may view sensitive financial data  
- Logs generated by ETL must not contain credentials  
- Local CSV files not to be shared outside GitHub (except clean versions)

---

# 6. Out-of-Scope Items

- Real-time streaming data ingestion  
- Machine learning beyond ARIMA validation  
- Customer churn prediction models  
- Integration with external CRMs or ERPs  
- Mobile-optimised dashboards  

---

# 7. Definition of Done (Project-Level)

The project is complete when:

- ETL automation runs daily without failure  
- Azure SQL always contains latest data  
- Power BI refresh succeeds in Service  
- All dashboard pages are functional  
- ARIMA validation results are documented  
- BA documentation is published (EPIC, stories, AC, etc.)  
- GitHub repo is complete with full structure
